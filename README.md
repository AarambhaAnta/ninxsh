`ninxsh` is a lightweight shell written in modern C++. It supports:

- **Enhanced Terminal Prompt**: Modern `username@hostname:path$` format with ANSI colors
- **Smart Prompt Display**: Colored prompt for interactive use, plain format when piped
- **Builtin Commands** (`exit`, `cd`, `clear`, `history`, `jobs`, `kill`, `fg`, `bg`)
- **External executable support** using `fork()` and `execvp()`
- **Input/output redirection** (`<`, `>`)
- **Command pipelines** (`|`) with multiple commands
- **Background process execution** (`&`)
- **Job control and management** (`jobs`, `kill <pid>`, `fg [job_id]`, `bg [job_id]`)
- **Signal handling** (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z)
- **Path expansion** (`~` to home directory)
- **Environment variable expansion** (`$HOME`, `$USER`, etc.)
- **Zombie process cleanup** with automatic job status updates
- DoS protection with configurable limits (centralized in `limits.hpp`)
- Comprehensive test suite for all features
- Command history with persistent storage and execution (`!!`, `!n`)
- Quoting (planned)

## Build Instructions

### Universal Build (Cross-Platform)

```bash
make         # Build the shell in default mode
make debug   # Build with debug symbols and without optimizations
make release # Build with optimizations
make sanitize # Build with sanitizers for catching memory issues
make format  # Format code using clang-format
make test    # Run the test suite
make install # Install the shell (requires sudo)
make clean   # Delete build artifacts
make help    # Show available commands
```

### Platform-Optimized Builds

For platform-specific optimizations and features, use the specialized Makefiles:

```bash
# macOS (Xcode toolchain, code signing, app bundles)
cd Resources/Mac && make

# Linux (distribution detection, package creation, valgrind)
cd Resources/Linux && make

# Windows (MinGW/MSYS2, installers, portable builds)
cd Resources/Windows && make
```

#### Platform-Specific Features

**macOS** (`Resources/Mac/`):

- Debug symbols for lldb (`make dsym`)
- Code signing (`make codesign`)
- App bundle creation (`make bundle`)
- Apple Silicon support (`make install-arm64`)

**Linux** (`Resources/Linux/`):

- Auto-detect distribution and package manager
- Memory testing (`make valgrind`)
- Performance profiling (`make perf`)
- Package creation (`make deb`, `make rpm`)
- Static builds (`make static`)

**Windows** (`Resources/Windows/`):

- NSIS installer creation (`make installer`)
- Portable ZIP packages (`make portable`)
- Static linking for portability
- MSYS2 dependency management (`make deps`)

## Developer Setup

To enable IDE features like auto-complete and jump-to-definition, generate a `compile_commands.json`:

```bash
make clean
bear -- make
```

## Progress Roadmap

### **Day 1** - Shell Initialization

- [x] Project compiles with `make`
- [x] **Print Prompt:** `ninxsh >`
- [x] Reads user input
- [x] Gracefully handles empty input and `Ctrl + C` (EOF)
- [x] Initial commits in Git

### **Day 2** - External Command Execution

- [x] Run external commands using `fork()` and `execvp()`
- [x] Supports basic Unix commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`, `date`, etc.
- [x] Basic error handling for invalid commands (shows "command not found")
- [x] Robust input tokenization and conversion to C-style argument arrays
- [x] Handles command execution filure gracefully without crashing
- [x] Proper memory management with `strdup()` and `free()`

### **Day 3** - Builtin Commands

- [x] Implemented `exit`
- [x] Implemented `cd [path]` (fallback `$HOME`)
- [x] Implemented `clear` using ANSI escape sequence
- [x] Implemented `history` with persistent storage and execution (`!!`, `!n`)
- [x] Implemented `jobs` for listing background jobs
- [x] Implemented `kill <pid>` for terminating processes
- [x] Implemented `fg [job_id]` for bringing jobs to foreground

### **Day 10** - Security & Performance Improvements

- [x] Added explicit error state handling to ParsedCommand structure
- [x] Implemented comprehensive DoS protection with input length validation
- [x] Prevented history pollution by validating commands before storage
- [x] Centralized all protection limits in `include/limits.hpp` header
- [x] Optimized regex compilation with static const patterns
- [x] Standardized test file naming to `test_*.cpp` convention
- [x] Added boundary condition tests and enhanced error reporting
- [x] Updated documentation with security features and architecture

## Security Features

### DoS Protection

- **Input Length Validation**: Commands longer than 4KB are rejected
- **Path Length Limits**: File paths longer than 2KB are handled gracefully  
- **String Processing Limits**: Environment variable expansion limited to 2KB strings
- **Centralized Configuration**: All limits defined in `include/limits.hpp`
- **Explicit Error Handling**: Clear error messages for rejected input
- **History Protection**: Invalid commands are not stored in command history

### Performance Optimizations

- **Static Regex Compilation**: Environment variable patterns compiled once
- **Early Exit Strategies**: Skip expensive operations when possible
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup with RAII patterns

## Testing

The ninxsh project includes a comprehensive C++ test suite covering all major functionality.

### Running All Tests

```bash
make test    # Run complete test suite
```

The test suite includes:

- **Command parsing** - Input tokenization and validation
- **Builtin commands** - All builtin functions (cd, exit, clear, history, jobs, kill, fg, bg)
- **External execution** - Fork/exec functionality and process management
- **I/O redirection & pipelines** - File redirection and command chaining
- **Signal handling** - Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, and process cleanup
- **Job management** - Background job tracking and control
- **History functionality** - Command storage and expansion
- **DoS protection** - Input validation and security limits
- **Utility functions** - Helper and utility code

All tests use a unified framework and report PASSED/FAILED status.

### Manual Testing Examples

```bash
# Test normal operation
echo "hello world"
cd ~
ls | grep txt

# Test history
history
!!
!1

# Test environment variables
echo $HOME
cd $HOME

# Test background jobs and job control
sleep 30 &           # Start background job
jobs                 # List active jobs
kill 1234            # Kill process by PID
fg 1                 # Bring job 1 to foreground
bg 1                 # Resume job 1 in background

# Test pipelines with background
ls -la | grep txt &  # Run pipeline in background
jobs                 # View the background pipeline
```
